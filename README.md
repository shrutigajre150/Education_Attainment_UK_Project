# Education_Attainment_UK_Project

This project investigates the influence of town size on educational success in the UK, focusing on high school and college graduation rates. The study is based on data from the Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) database, specifically analyzing students who completed their GCSEs in the 2012-2013 academic year.

Key Findings:

Higher Graduation Rates in Small Towns:

Small towns exhibited higher mean high school graduation rates (62.02%) compared to large towns (60.20%).
College graduation rates were also higher in small towns (31.59%) versus large towns (27.53%).

Socioeconomic Factors:

Smaller towns had a lower proportion of higher deprivation (31%) compared to larger towns (50%).
A significant relationship was found between town size and income levels, with income deprivation more common in large towns.
Statistical Analysis:

Independent two-sample t-tests indicated significant differences in graduation rates, with small towns outperforming large towns.
A chi-squared test confirmed a strong link between town size and income levels.
Linear regression analysis showed that high school graduation rates are strong predictors of college degree completion.
Conclusion: The study concludes that town size significantly impacts educational outcomes, with students in small towns achieving better results. It highlights the need for policies to address educational inequalities, particularly in larger towns, and suggests further research into additional factors influencing educational success.
